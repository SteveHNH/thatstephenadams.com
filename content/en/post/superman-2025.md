This review may contain spoilers.

 I have been excited for this Superman movie since the day I heard James Gunn was going to take a stab at bringing him back to the screen. I loved all of James Gunn's movies and I honestly think he's only gotten better over time. He's someone I know cares deeply for story and the characters he's put in charge of. He pours his soul into all of it and seems like the kind of guy that doesn't want to start a project unless he can get it right.

I'm happy to say that all the hopes I put into him pulling off a Superman movie were absolutely warranted. The guy knocked it out of the park.

I have never hated a Superman movie. Several of them were great, most of them have left much to be desired, and if I had to some it up I might just say I left them disappointed. Man of Steel was probably the movie I was most excited for and despite Henry Cavill being a dang near perfect pick for Superman, he couldn't save the movie from a poor script and an overall lack of understanding of why Superman would ever bother being a hero.

This version of Superman is so much closer to the Superman that I know from the comic books, the old TV show, and Christopher Reeve. That earnest belief in the right thing. He's just a sweet, innocent guy with great powers who believes that saving people is the right thing just because it is. You don't need a reason to not kill, or to put others first, or to stop a building from falling. You do it because your heart tells you that to do nothing is wrong. Plain and simple. 

I could write a lot about why Superman was perfect in this movie, but the cast that surrounds him is equally important. Rachel Brosnahan absolutely crushed it as Lois Lane. She's the high spirited reporter that we know and love, and she really makes Superman think about what he's doing. She's a loving foil to his blind eyed hopes. It's a joy to watch them on screen with each other and know what the future holds for them. Seeing two polar opposites come together because they choose to is just wonderful.

Nicholas Hoult rounding out the trio as Lex was electrifying. We have not had a notable Lex Luthor on the big screen since '78. Don't get me wrong, I love what Gene Hackman did with his material, but the material was kind of the problem. I don't blame that movie because that was kind of how villains were in those days. There was a lot of screwball comedy in how they worked. This Lex was something else entirely. A dispicable human being and someone who hated Superman not for what he could do, but for what he was. He's an alien who saves everyone and takes attention away from Lex's own pursuits. He's full of hate and anger and it is captured so well in every seen he's in. There is nothing to like about this guy, and that's why I love it so much.

The Justice Gang (name pending) was a hoot. An absolute hoot. They aren't awesome and altruistic like Superman is. They won't even let him join the team, and I find that absolutely amazing. Mr. Terrific of the three definitely steals the show, but Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner is pitch perfect. He's such a total jerk and the antithesis of Superman. He's not a bad guy, but he's definitely a flawed guy who just happens to mostly do the right thing. I wish Hawkgirl had a bit more to do, but this movie was already doing a ton of heavy lifting and I know she has an arc in the upcoming Lanters or Peacemaker so maybe we'lll get to see more of her.

I can't even begin to write how much I loved Clark's parents. They were pitch perfect on screen and were one of the many reasons I shed a tear watching this. They are simple, sweet people and everything Clark is comes from how much they love him. Two people who were unable to have their own kids were given a gift and it shows how much they treasure him and who he is. I adored them. Not to mention they nailed the "simple country people" character. Ma Kent yelling into the speakerphone might be my favorite thing I've ever seen. I loved every moment they were on screen.

I've seen a lot of complaints that the plot was convoluted, but I'm not sure what movie they were watching. I followed it really well and had a blast with some of the sidequests that showed up. Even when Superman is silly, it's doing what it's supposed to do. It's a silly movie. It's a silly premise. Superman himself is a bit silly, but couldn't we use a little bit more silly in our superhero movies. 

Seeing this movie turn out as good as it did was just a dream come true for me. I got to share it with my mom, who got me into loving Superman in the first place. 

I'm so happy with what James Gunn brought us. There's so much more I could gush about, but if you made it this far, I'm going to let you go. Go see the movie. I'm going to see it for a second time in about an hour and I'm just as excited as the first time.

Up, up, and away!
