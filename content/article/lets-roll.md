I think I finally wrangled this blog into something I can use. I spent most of the day fighting with issues getting the theme to load based on an integrity signature on some of the javascript files but now I'm wondering if it was a completely different bug causing the issues. Apparently, Ublock Origin in Firefox was breaking some functionality in this theme that I'm using. So while I like what I ended up with, if people running that extension have issues with viewing the site, then I'm not getting anywhere. It could just be me too. I guess I need to do some more testing, but overall I'm pretty happy.

My main goal here is to get this blog to be the place where I can point folks when they ask, "Where can we find your work?" So far I've had to point people at a difficult [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/stevehnh) url or to a site I barely maintain. I'm not sure how much I'll post here, but let's just say I have good intentions.

Let's roll!
