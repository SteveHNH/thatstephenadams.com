Saying "first" is kind of an old internet thing that was fun back when every website had a comment section. I remember seeing it on Ain't It Cool News way back in the day. I haven't been there in a long time but I imagine that's probably still a thing over there.

I started up this blog mostly to try out the Ghost blogging platform. It's open source and I can run it for pretty cheap on a cloud server somewhere so I figured it was worth a try. Who knows if I'll keep it but I am looking for a simpler way to keep notes.

The big question I have right now is whether I should roll all my blog posts from the old blog over at 2dSteve and put it over here, or just start fresh. I had my 40th birthday recently so there's some kind of natural urge to either start over or start trying more random stuff. That's probably the millenial version of a midlife crisis. I'm not buying a hot rod or a motorcycle, but I'm starting over a blog since the old one contains so much old stuff that neither I nor anyone else actually still cares about.

So here we go. I'm Stephen. Let's see where this leads.
