![Karate Kid: Legends Poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/1/1/3/3/3/911333-karate-kid-legends-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=b1e2bd1286)

**Rating:** ★★★ (3.0/5)

Not too shabby! Nothing to get too excited about, but the fights were fun. It definitely felt like a karate kid retelling but I was good with it. I don’t know if we needed to unite both the Jackie Chan and Ralph Maccio storylines in the end. The story didn’t really need it but I enjoyed it anyway. Good Saturday afternoon flick. 

I wrote this in my phone real quick. Don’t judge me.
