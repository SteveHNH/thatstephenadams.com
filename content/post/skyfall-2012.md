**Rating:** ★★★★ (4.0/5)

When I originally watched Skyfall in the theatre when it came out, it was the first Bond movie that I felt like I could follow from start to finish and the plot was clear. It was also a movie that included so many little baby steps back to being the Bond we know and love from before the Pierce Brosnan era. We got the Astin Marin, we got Q, we got a new M, and we got that M's office with the padded door. It was kind of a return to form.

After watching it this time, I definitely still hold to a lot of the original opinions I have, but I think that it is not at the top of my list like it used to be. I'm more keen on Casino Royale these days. That being said there is a lot to love in this movie.

One of those things that I loved the most was Javier Bardem's Silva. That character wasn't super interesting on the page, but the way Javier plays him is incredible. The monologue he has about the rats and the coconut is so masterfully done. I love everything about what he does. He makes such amazing choices. It's hard to even look away from the screen.

This movie carries a lot and tries to do a lot, and it mostly succeeds. I definitely enjoyed my rewatch.
