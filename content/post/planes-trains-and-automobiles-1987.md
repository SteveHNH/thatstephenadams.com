**Rating:** ★★★★ (4.0/5)

I love this movie. It's pretty much the GOAT of all road trip buddy comedy movies. John Candy is brilliant as Del and Steve Martin plays such an incredible straight man against him. At the time Steve Martin was very known for being a "wild and crazy guy" and this has him playing a very believable businessman curmudgeon. 

It also has loads of heart. John Candy's "I like me" speech stands out as one of the highlights of his whole career and it's really not that long. Its all carried by the way he's reacting to Steve Martin's punishing insults.

And let's not forget the wonderful f-bomb laden rental car scene. Which is basically the only reason this thing is rated R. 

Such a great movie, and a perfect film for Thanksgiving.
