![Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald Poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/8/3/6/5/268365-fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3c5528fd13)

**Rating:** ★★★ (3.0/5)

I was way more into this movie than the first one. That being said, I don't have a clue what it was about and I watched it just a few days ago. Something about finding out who Creedence really was and Grindelwald having secret meetings. 

It was pretty cool to see everything happen in Paris. That whole city was a fun setting for some magic stuff.

I don't fully understand why Queenie joined up with Grindelwald or why Leta Lestrange just randomly walked into the blue fire. Nothing about that made a whole lot of sense to me.

I wanted a little bit more whimsy out of this and it was mostly super dark and depressing. Very few people were having a good time here.
