I was infected, but now I'm healed! 

It was a long and annoying journey and I feel like I now have a better understanding of what some people go through when they have some kind of illness that they can't figure out. I was definitely not as bad off as a lot of folks but I thought it would never end.

After finally getting in with a dermatologist, I was able to get a diagnosis of contact dermatitis derived eczema. The dude was absolutely certain that I got into something that set off an allergic reaction and turned into some gnarly eczema and what I needed was steroids. I told him that I'd been through a steroid treatment and he basically told me that the urgent care offices generally don't know how to fight this the way they should. I told him they put me on steroids for 5 days and he shook his head and told me that was not nearly long enough. The guy was super sure of himself, but I think that might be what I needed anyway. His staff asked me a handful of questions about the history and he came in like a whirlwind and gave me the diagnosis. They see this kind of thing all the time so I shouldn't be that surprised.

So, I'm about a week after he saw me and my skin is back in good shape. It was a couple days after starting the mega steroids he gave me that the itching truly stopped and my skin isn't nearly as red as it was. It was awful before I got help. I really wasn't sure if the itching was ever going to stop. Sleeping has been really nice. I'm glad I'm feeling better. Now I just have to figure out what caused it in the first place so I never have to go through that again. Whew boy! It was a doozy.
