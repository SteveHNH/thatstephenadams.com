![Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore Poster](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/8/3/6/6/268366-fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9f87b69904)

**Rating:** ★★ (2.0/5)

I don't even know what to say.

The second one was fine. This one was so dark so much of the time. I was also thrown off by Mads Mikkelson taking over as Grindelwald. Not mad about it, but it was a bit jarring. They didn't even really keep the bleach blonde hair and blue eye. If you're not keeping up with movie news and casting decisions, I think it would have taken a minute to get your bearings here.

I love Jude Law as Dumbledore. He's so fun to watch and has that little sparkle in his eye that Richard Harris had when he played the character.

All that being said, I don't know why these movies were made. It's like a trilogy was mandatory. I really enjoy the wizarding world stuff and all the fun stories you could tell there, but I'm not sure I have liked much of any of this story. It makes sense to me that they wrote "Fantastic Beasts" so small on the movie poster. They're here, but they certainly aren't the focus of the movie.

In the end, I guess I'm glad I watched it. But if Dumbledore's big secret is that he's gay, then that was the worst kept secret ever. If the secret was that Dumbledore's brother (who is also a Dumbledore) had a kid (who is also a Dumbledore) then that's a decent secret. I guess this whole title could be referencing any one of the Dumbledores. 

Okay. I've already thought to much about this.
