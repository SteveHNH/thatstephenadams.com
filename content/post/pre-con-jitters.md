We're on the eve of my annual trek to Atlanta where I gather together with a bunch of other nerds and pretend we're the coolest people in the world for a weekend. I can't wait! Some people get hyped for the Super Bowl, but I'm sitting here getting hyped to wander around a bunch of hotels with 80,000 other weirdos. For me, getting to be a part of the Digital Media Track at Dragon Con is a bit of a dream come true. Some of my best friends work that track and I really never was sure it would be a place I belonged.

I remember my first trip to Dragon Con back in 2010. The podcast track was rolling along pretty well and I found out that some of my favorite podcasters were going to be there. Ashley and I were really trying to make Horseshoes & Hand Grenades work back then but we really had no idea how to do it. We just went to the con, talked to a bunch of people, met up with some friends, and generally had a great time there. That feels like ages ago now.

Fast forward a few years to 2019 and we did a LIVE show there. That was honestly the nuttiest thing that ever happened. I couldn't believe that I was up on stage or on a panel talking about my love of digital media on one panel, then joking about broken toilets during our live show. It was surreal. It's really thanks to Ashley just sending emails out that made it work. I will never doubt the power of a well placed email at this point.

Today, I'm preparing for six panels ranging from building communities to improving your ability to trust yourself. It went from a couple shows I thought would be neat, to pitching several panels every year that end up usually doing really well. I'm proud of the work we put in and how everything turns out. I think we generally get good positive feedback. More than anything, though, I'm excited to get to see my friends and meet other creators. I love encouraging folks to get out there and make the things they've been dreaming of. I'm as unsure of myself as the next person, but having someone come along to help push is such a godsend sometimes. I try to be that for the people that swing by to say hello or have questions or want help.

I'll probably never be more exhausted than after this trip and likely on Monday when we're coming home, but it's the best kind of exhausted to be. Exhausted by having met and chatted with so many people, trying to remember so many names, and making sure the people I interact with know they have value. That's all I really want out of it. I'm going to get out there and do my best to make it happen.
